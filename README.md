Intel(R) Integrated Performance Primitives Cryptography
=======================================================

Intel(R) Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel(R) IPP) Cryptography
is a software library that provides a broad range of secure and
efficient cryptographic algorithm implementations:

-   Symmetric Cryptography Primitive Functions (AES, SM4, TDES, RC4)

-   One-Way Hash Primitives (SHA, MD5, SM3)

-   Data Authentication Primitive Functions (HMAC, CMAC)

-   Public Key Cryptography Functions (RSA, DLP, ECC)

-   Finite Field Arithmetic Functions

Intel(R) IPP Cryptography provides multiple function implementations
optimized for various Intel(R) CPUs, and can be set up to use dispatching
to select the CPU-specific implementation at run time. Dispatching refers to
the detection of features supported by the underlying CPU and selecting
the corresponding Intel IPP Cryptography binary path.

Building from Source
--------------------

### Required Software

-   C/C++ compiler (see [System Requirements](#system-requirements))

-   Assembly compiler (see [System Requirements](#system-requirements))

-   CMake (see [System Requirements](#system-requirements))

-   Python (see [System Requirements](#system-requirements))

-   Microsoft Visual Studio\* (Windows\* OS only)

-   Android NDK (only for cross-platform build for Android\* OS on Linux\* OS)

### Build Steps

Note that we tested only the build process defined in `CMakeLists.txt`
with the options described in [CMake Arguments](#cmake-arguments).

1.  Download and install all [Required Software](#required-software).

2.  Clone the source code from GitHub\* as follows:
    ```
    git clone --recursive <repo>
    ```
3.  Set the environment variables for one of the supported C/C++
    compilers; for Intel(R)Compiler please refer to
    https://software.intel.com/en-us/cpp-compiler-18.0-developer-guide-and-reference-specifying-the-location-of-compiler-components-with-compilervars

4.  Run CMake\* on the command line. Example CMake lines for different
    operating systems:

    **Windows\* OS**:

    ```
    cmake CMakeLists.txt -Bbuild -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -T"Intel C++ Compiler 18.0"
    ```

    **Linux\* OS**:

    ```
    CC=icc CXX=icpc cmake CMakeLists.txt -Bbuild -DARCH=intel64
    ```

    **macOS\***:

    ```
    CC=icc CXX=icpc cmake CMakeLists.txt -Bbuild -DARCH=intel64 -DUSEYASM=<path to Yasm compiler>
    ```

    The list of supported CMake arguments is available in the
    [CMake Arguments](#cmake-arguments) section.

5.  Go to the build folder specified when running CMake, then do one of
    the following:

    -   On Windows\* OS: open the Microsoft Visual Studio\* solution and
        run a build.

        **Important:** the process used to build the Microsoft Visual Studio solutions results
        in debug information being generated for assembly files by default for both Debug and
        Release configurations. To build Intel IPP Cryptography library binaries without debug
        information in the Release configuration, follow these steps:

        1. Right-click a project file and select **Properties**.
        2. In the **Configuration** drop-down list, select **Release**.
        3. Select the **Microsoft Macro Assembler** tab.
        4. Set the value of the **Generate Debug Information** option to **No**.
        5. Repeat steps 1-3 for all projects you want to build.

    -   On Linux\* OS or macOS\*: start a build using makefiles.

    At this point, you can shoose to build either static or dynamic libraries.
    Depending on the value of the `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL` option in the `cmake` call in
    step 4, you will get a set of separate self-contained libraries optimized
    for particular platforms, or a dispatched library with all optimizations.
    See the description of `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL` in [CMake Arguments](#cmake-arguments)
    for more information.

    Built libraries are located in
    the `<build_dir>/.build/lib` directory.

### CMake Arguments

#### Common CMake Arguments for All Supported Operating Systems:

-   `-B<build-dir>` - defines the build directory. This is the directory
    where CMake puts the generated Microsoft Visual Studio\* solution or
    makefiles.

-   `-DARCH=<ia32|intel64>` - on Linux* OS and macOS*, defines the target architecture
    for the build of the Intel IPP Cryptography library. On Windows* OS, use `-G`
    instead. See the description of the `-G` option [below](#windows-os-cmake-arguments)
    for details.

-   `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Defines the configuration
    of the Intel IPP Cryptography library to build:

    -   `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=on`: default configuration. Build of a dispatched
        static library with all available optimizations; build of dynamic
        libraries with a dynamic dispatcher library.

    -   `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off`: build of one static library per
        optimization; build of one dynamic library per optimization.

-   `-DTHREADED_LIB:BOOL=<off|on>` - optional. Defines the threading
    configuration of the Intel IPP Cryptography library to build:

    -   `-DTHREADED_LIB:BOOL=off`: default. Build single-threaded Intel IPP
        Cryptography library

    -   `-DTHREADED_LIB:BOOL=on`: build multi-threaded Intel IPP Cryptography
        library.

-   `-DPLATFORM_LIST="<platform list>"` - optional, works only if
    `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` is set. Sets target platforms for the code
    to be compiled. See the supported platform list at
    <https://software.intel.com/en-us/ipp-dev-guide-dispatching>.

    -   example for Linux\* OS and the IA-32 architecture:
        `-DPLATFORM_LIST="m7;s8;p8;g9;h9"`

    -   example for Linux\* OS and the Intel(R) 64 architecture:
        `-DPLATFORM_LIST="w7;n8;y8;e9;l9;n0;k0"`

**Note:** you can set C/C++ compilers for Linux\* OS and macOS\* using the
`CC` and `CXX` variables before calling `cmake`. For example:

```
CC=<path to C compiler> CXX=<path to C++ compiler> cmake <Arguments>
```

#### Windows\* OS CMake Arguments:

-   `-G"<tool-chain-generator>"` - defines the native build system CMake
    will generate from the input files. For example, `-G"Visual Studio
    12 2013"` will generate a solution for the Microsoft Visual Studio\*
    2013 IDE, `-G"Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"` will generate a solution
    for the Microsoft Visual Studio\* 2013 IDE for the Intel(R) 64
    architecture.

-   `-T<Compiler>` - defines the compiler for building, for example,
    `-T"Intel C++ Compiler 18.0"` defines Intel(R) Compiler 18.0 for
    building.

**Note:** Refer to CMake documentation for more information on these options.

#### Linux\* OS CMake Arguments:

-   `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=<off|on>` - optional. Defines whether the built
    library will be position-dependent or not:

    -   `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=off:` default. Position-independent code.

    -   `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=on:` position-dependent code.

    This parameter does not work together with the `--DANDROID` parameter.

-   `-DANDROID:BOOL=on` defines cross-platform build for Android\* OS.

-   `-D_CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=<GNU toolchain prefix>` - used only
    for cross-platform build for Android\* OS. Defines the GNU toolchain
    prefix to compiler tools. For example, `"i686-linux-android-"`
    defines the prefix for i686 GNU\* compiler tools, and
    `"x86_64-linux-android-"` defines the prefix for x86_64 GNU compiler
    tools.

    **Note:** Before running CMake scripts for cross-platform build for
    Android\* OS, you need to do the following:

    1.  Set the following environment variables for Android\* NDK:

        -   ANDROID_NDK_ROOT defines the path to the Android\* NDK Root.

        -   ANDROID_SYSROOT defines the path to the Android\* NDK System
            Root.

        -   ANDROID_GNU_X86_TOOLCHAIN defines the path to the Android\*
            GNU toolchain.

        -   ANDROID_GNU_X86_LIBPATH defines the path to the Android\* GNU
            toolchain libraries.

    2.  Add `'$ANDROID_GNU_X86_TOOLCHAIN/bin'` to the `PATH`
        environment variable.

#### macOS\* CMake Arguments:

-   `-DUSEYASM=<path to Yasm* assembly>` - defines the path to the
    Yasm\* assembly compiler.
